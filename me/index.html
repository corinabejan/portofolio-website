              <p>I don't know how to start this...it's such a long story. I am 31 years old, I live in Utrecht, and I
                can't wait to start The Academy.
                I am a very communicative and sociable person, I like dicovering new things every day(curiosity is my
                biggest fault and quality at the same time).
                I love reading(best occupation ever), I find cooking very relaxing and I try to do it as much as
                possible and I like traveling(the world is a marvelous place to see).
                My motto that I live by is: <span>"The stairs to nowhere can bring you higher than the sky"</span>.

                      <p>I dicovered programming in august last year. It took me a long time to decide if I should start
                        with it or not because I was afraid i won't get it. <span>BUT I DID!</span> I started with HTML and
                        I was immediately absorbed by the fact that out of nothing I could now start to create something wonderful.
                        And then... My curiosity kicked in... I immediately started to explore CSS and of course JavaScript. The beginning 
                        was easy, but step by step it started to get more complicated. It's absolutely fascinating the power of this programming
                        language, and what how rewarding it can feel every time when a milestone is passed, and i passed a few by now.
                        <span>Starting coding was one of my best decissions that I ever took!</span>

                    <div class="row">
                      <p>My projects over this period of time where sometimes simple, sometimes really challenging but 
                        I enjoyed every moment of this journey. The one person who never, but absolutely never let me say
                        that anything is difficult is my <span>best friend</span>. She, herself, is a Software Engineer, 
                        and she is a  great and inimaginably smart person.
                        I actually believe that coding brought us much closer than we was before.<span>Thank you Programming for making my life so much better!</span>
